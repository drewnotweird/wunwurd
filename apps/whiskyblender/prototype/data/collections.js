/**
 * DAWN EQUIVALENT: Shopify collection objects (collection.json metafield data)
 *
 * In Dawn these are Liquid objects accessed as {{ collection.title }}, {{ collection.products }}, etc.
 * Here they are plain JS objects keyed by handle, loaded into window.WB_COLLECTIONS.
 *
 * Field mapping to Shopify/Dawn:
 *   handle        → collection.handle
 *   title         → collection.title
 *   description   → collection.description
 *   coverImage    → collection.image.src
 *   products      → collection.products[].handle (resolved via WB_PRODUCTS)
 *   showCollabCta → custom metafield — whether to show the "let's collaborate" band
 *
 * template: 'default'   → collection.html  (hero image + product grid + optional collab CTA)
 * template: 'occasions' → occasion.html    (hero image + wb-products include + wb-createunique CTA)
 * template: null        → shop filter only, not a navigable collection page
