# drewnotweird — project notes for Claude

## Repo structure
Each app lives in `apps/<name>/frontend/` (Vite + React). Deployed via GitHub Actions to Fasthosts shared hosting via FTP, into `htdocs/<name>/`.

## Deployment

### Base path
Every app is served at `/<name>/` not `/`. This requires two things:
1. Vite config must read `base: process.env.VITE_BASE_PATH || '/'` and the workflow must set `VITE_BASE_PATH: /<name>/`
2. **`BrowserRouter` must have `basename={import.meta.env.BASE_URL}`** — without this the router won't match any routes and the page renders blank with no console errors

### Photos / large assets
The deploy workflow skips `.jpg` files by default (they're slow and already on the server after first deploy). Use `workflow_dispatch` with `upload_photos: true` to upload photos. The portfolio workflow has this pattern — copy it.

### FTP
Fasthosts FTP drops connections after ~20 files. Reconnect every 20 uploads. Always use `set_pasv(True)`.

### Vite bin symlink
On this machine, `npm install` sometimes creates `node_modules/.bin/vite` as a plain file instead of a symlink, causing `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Fix: `rm node_modules/.bin/vite && ln -s ../vite/bin/vite.js node_modules/.bin/vite`

## Apps

### bigjuicy
- Physics wall of Tennent's photos using Matter.js
- 3 collision layers (z-index 10/20/30) so photos visually interleave
- Photos in `public/photos/`, listed in `src/data/images.js`
- Background: `#ffc72c`, brand red: `#ce0e2d`, font: Stag
- Drag targets topmost card via `Matter.Query.point` + z-index comparison on mousedown

### pointing
- Photos follow the cursor/touch; hotspots calibrated per photo in `src/data/images.js`

## Conventions
- DOM-managed animation (no React state in render loops) — use refs + `requestAnimationFrame`
- Avoid `setInterval` for things that need dynamic rates; use recursive `setTimeout` instead
